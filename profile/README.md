> The gathering space for the organvm system — salons, reading groups, and collaborative encounters where theory meets practice through shared inquiry.

## Purpose

ORGAN-VI houses the community infrastructure for the [organvm eight-organ system](https://github.com/meta-organvm). Where other organs produce theory (I), art (II), products (III), governance (IV), documentation (V), and outreach (VII), ORGAN-VI creates the conditions for *encounter* — structured spaces where contributors, collaborators, and curious observers engage with the system's ideas through dialogue rather than consumption.

The community organ operates on the principle that a creative-institutional system is incomplete without a participatory layer. Salons, reading groups, and collaborative workshops are not marketing activities (that's ORGAN-VII) or documentation (that's ORGAN-V) — they are generative spaces where the system's theoretical commitments are tested, challenged, and extended by people other than the original author.

## Current Status

ORGAN-VI is in the **planning phase**. The organizational infrastructure exists ([organvm-vi-koinonia](https://github.com/organvm-vi-koinonia) on GitHub), but substantive community repositories have not yet been created. This is by design — community spaces should launch with active programming, not empty repositories.

**Planned repositories:**
- `salon-series` — Structured salon events exploring themes across the eight-organ system
- `reading-groups` — Collaborative reading and discussion infrastructure

## Planned Initiatives

### Salon Series
Recurring events organized around themes that cross organ boundaries. Each salon pairs a theoretical concern (ORGAN-I) with a practical demonstration (ORGAN-II or III), creating a structured space for discussion that is neither lecture nor open-ended conversation.

### Reading Groups
Collaborative close reading of the system's foundational documents, academic references, and related work. Reading groups provide the interpretive community that prevents a solo-practice system from becoming insular.

## Connection to the Eight-Organ System

| Organ | Relationship to ORGAN-VI |
|-------|--------------------------|
| I (Theory) | Provides intellectual content for salons and reading groups |
| II (Art) | Supplies demonstrations, performances, and experiential material |
| III (Commerce) | Potential venue for user feedback sessions and product community |
| IV (Orchestration) | Defines governance rules for community participation |
| V (Public Process) | Documents community outcomes and methodology |
| VII (Marketing) | Amplifies community events and outcomes |
| VIII (Meta) | ORGAN-VI reports to the meta-org umbrella |

**Dependency direction:** ORGAN-VI consumes from I, II, III (no back-edges). Community activities respond to what the system produces; they do not dictate upstream organ priorities.
