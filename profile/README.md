## Purpose

ORGAN-VI houses the community infrastructure for the [organvm eight-organ system](https://github.com/meta-organvm). Where other organs produce theory (I), art (II), products (III), governance (IV), documentation (V), and outreach (VII), ORGAN-VI creates the conditions for *encounter* — structured spaces where contributors, collaborators, and curious observers engage with the system's ideas through dialogue rather than consumption.

The community organ operates on the principle that a creative-institutional system is incomplete without a participatory layer. Salons, reading groups, and collaborative workshops are not marketing activities (that's ORGAN-VII) or documentation (that's ORGAN-V) — they are generative spaces where the system's theoretical commitments are tested, challenged, and extended by people other than the original author.

## Philosophy

The name *Koinonia* (κοινωνία) is drawn from classical Greek, where it denotes fellowship, communion, and shared participation in a common life. In Aristotle's political philosophy, koinonia describes the bonds that make a community more than a collection of individuals — it is the active practice of holding something in common. In early Christian usage, the term carried the weight of mutual obligation: participants in koinonia are not audience members but co-creators of the space they inhabit.

ORGAN-VI applies this concept to creative-institutional practice. Community here is not an afterthought bolted onto a production system. It is *infrastructure* — as essential as the governance layer (ORGAN-IV) or the theoretical foundations (ORGAN-I). The conviction is that ideas sharpened only by their author become brittle. Salons and reading groups introduce the friction of other perspectives, the generosity of collaborative interpretation, and the accountability that comes from explaining your work to someone who did not build it.

This is community as creative infrastructure: the deliberate construction of spaces where encounter is possible.

## Current Status

ORGAN-VI is in **early development**. The organizational infrastructure exists ([organvm-vi-koinonia](https://github.com/organvm-vi-koinonia) on GitHub), but substantive community repositories are being designed rather than deployed. This is intentional — community spaces should launch with active programming and clear formats, not empty repositories waiting for participants to arrive.

**Planned repositories:**
- `salon-series` — Structured salon events exploring themes across the eight-organ system
- `reading-groups` — Collaborative reading and discussion infrastructure

## Planned Initiatives

### Salon Series

Recurring events organized around themes that cross organ boundaries. Each salon pairs a theoretical concern (ORGAN-I) with a practical demonstration (ORGAN-II or III), creating a structured space for discussion that is neither lecture nor open-ended conversation. The salon format draws from the European tradition of curated intellectual gathering: a prepared provocation, a demonstration or reading, and a structured exchange that produces documented outcomes rather than evaporating after the event.

Salon topics will emerge from the system's own tensions — places where theoretical commitments meet implementation reality, where artistic ambition encounters technical constraint, where the question of what constitutes a "product" in a creative-institutional context remains genuinely open.

### Reading Groups

Collaborative close reading of the system's foundational documents, academic references, and related work. Reading groups provide the interpretive community that prevents a solo-practice system from becoming insular. Planned formats include:

- **Internal readings** — Close examination of the organvm system's own documents (genesis transcripts, specifications, architectural decisions)
- **External readings** — Engagement with the academic and creative traditions the system draws from (systems theory, institutional design, recursive epistemology)
- **Cross-organ readings** — Joint sessions where participants from different organ contexts read the same material through their respective disciplinary lenses

### Community Governance

As ORGAN-VI matures, its governance structures will be developed in coordination with ORGAN-IV (Orchestration). Participation norms, contribution guidelines, and the protocols for translating community insights back into the system will be documented as living specifications rather than fixed rules.

## Connection to the Eight-Organ System

| Organ | Relationship to ORGAN-VI |
|-------|--------------------------|
| I (Theory) | Provides intellectual content for salons and reading groups |
| II (Art) | Supplies demonstrations, performances, and experiential material |
| III (Commerce) | Potential venue for user feedback sessions and product community |
| IV (Orchestration) | Defines governance rules for community participation |
| V (Public Process) | Documents community outcomes and methodology |
| VII (Marketing) | Amplifies community events and outcomes |
| VIII (Meta) | ORGAN-VI reports to the meta-org umbrella |

**Dependency direction:** ORGAN-VI consumes from I, II, III (no back-edges). Community activities respond to what the system produces; they do not dictate upstream organ priorities.
